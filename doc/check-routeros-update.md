# Notify on RouterOS update

[◀ Go back to main README](../)

## Description

The primary use of this script is to notify about RouterOS updates.

Run from a terminal you can start the update process or schedule it.

Centrally managing update process of several devices is possibly by specifying versions safe to be updated on a web server.

Also installing patch updates \(where just last digit is increased\) automatically is supported.

## Requirements and installation

Just install the script:

```text
$ScriptInstallUpdate check-routeros-update;
```

And add a scheduler for automatic update notification:

```text
/ system scheduler add interval=1d name=check-routeros-update on-event="/ system script run check-routeros-update;" start-time=startup;
```

## Configuration

Configuration is required only if you want to control update process with safe versions from a web server. The configuration goes to `global-config-overlay`, this is the parameter:

* `SafeUpdateNeighbor`: install updates automatically if seen in neighbor list
* `SafeUpdatePatch`: install patch updates automatically
* `SafeUpdateUrl`: url to check for safe update, the channel \(`long-term`,

  `stable` or `testing`\) is appended

## Usage and invocation

Be notified when run from scheduler or run it manually:

```text
/ system script run check-routeros-update;
```

If an update is found you can install it right away.

Installing script [packages-update](packages-update.md) gives extra options.
